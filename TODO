Make DC/DC convertor

Putl BQ7** in schenatic lib and all other comp thats missing

Add all missing comp to pcb new pretty lib

Chose what MCU we are going to use (must have CAN interface and presumably one other like SMBus or I2C or maybe 1W for communication with ECU) also it should hold control of two bq7* (they are the same sheet)`
