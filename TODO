Make DC/DC convertor

Putl BQ7** in schenatic lib and all other comp thats missing

Add all missing comp to pcb new pretty lib

Chose what MCU we are going to use (must have CAN interface and presumably one other like SMBus or I2C or maybe 1W for communication with ECU) also it should hold control of two bq7* (they are the same sheet)`   

After picking MCU make basic code for communication with BQ(look datasheet for exp.) 

Basic block diagram of battery balancing

Code for are board

PCB designn (be carefull 100V and more) - 2 PCB one BMS other DC/DC(BMS board is controling DC/DC board maybe you can put another MCU on that board)

Because batterys would be on two sides a seperate BMS board with two separated(but they should communicate with each other and if we are going to this desing we could add another MCU just for comm with ECU) 


IN this document ECU is a RaspPI and its only purpose is monitor and general contorl
