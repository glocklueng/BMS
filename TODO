Make DC/DC converter

Add all missing comp to pcb new pretty lib

Chose what MCU we are going to use (must have CAN interface and presumably one other like SMBus or I2C or maybe 1W for communication with ECU) also it should hold control of two bq7* (they are the same sheet)`   
Some possible MCU-s stm32f4(maybe to much processor power but we have some basic code for CAN etc.), some TI ARM cortec m4, DSC from Maxim(not magazine; it company) we have DS80C390 and DS80C400
for DSC tutorila http://techblog.pulkit.eu/8051_setup
maybe it would be easier to use arm mcu but it's your choice 
datasheet for stm32f can be found in other project Bldc-motors

After picking MCU make basic code for communication with BQ(look datasheet for exp.)

Basic block diagram of battery balancing

Code for are board

PCB designn (be carefull 100V and more) - 2 PCB one BMS other DC/DC(BMS board is controling DC/DC board maybe you can put another MCU on that board) - medic

Because batterys would be on two sides a separate BMS board with two separated(but they should communicate with each other and if we are going to this design we could add another MCU just for comm with ECU) 

IN this document ECU is a RaspPI and its only purpose is monitor and general control

Determinater values of R and C in scheme (please write how you did it so others can check)

Putl BQ7** in schenatic lib and all other comp thats missing
